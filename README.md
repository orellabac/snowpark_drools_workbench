# Drools Workbench customized Image

The `Dockerfile` in this directory is used to build a custom Docker image for Drools Workbench.

To build the image, run the following command:

```
./build.sh
```
>> You need to adjust the variables in the `build.sh` script to match your environment.

This will build an image named `drools-workbench` using the `Dockerfile` in this directory.

To run the Drools Workbench container, use the following command:

```
./run.sh
```
