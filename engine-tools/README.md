# Engine-Tools for Drools

This project contains a set of tools to help with the development of Drools applications.

Mostly this project is used to package all required drools jars into a FAT jar that can be deployed once, so we dont have to worry about the dependencies of drools.

## Build

To build the project, run the following command:

```
mvn clean install
```

This will build the project and package it into a JAR file.
